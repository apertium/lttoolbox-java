lt-validate (to validate XML dictionaries) :
 - works great, at least with rng
 - I don't remember whether i have tested it with dtd
 - there is a problem of depedencies with maven
(works well if I run it from netbeans, 
but otherwise, a ClassNotFound exception is thrown...)

lt-comp :
 - works exactly as the c++ version
 - but is slower
 - I think I know a way to gain some speed, I'll try that
 - Maybe there are still a thing or two that can be uniformized between lt-comp and lt-expand
 - the code is cleaned (all unecessary comments removed, some refactoring too)

lt-proc :
 - still bugged, but really close to be working (I think)
 - the code needs to be cleaned
 - maybe a bit refactored as well

lt-expand :
 - works exactly as the c++ version
 - nearly as fast on my computer, so speed is not a problem here
 - the code is cleaned (all unecessary comments removed, some refactoring too)
 - Maybe there are still a thing or two that can be uniformized between lt-comp and lt-expand
